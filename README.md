--What requirements did you achieve?
I added alt text to images and tabindex to allow screen readers to select and read the alt texts. It works with my screen reader.

--Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
Buttons are not working, no keyboard interaction, images do not adjust for different screen sizes.
I tried messing with JS to make the buttons work but couldn't. I understand parts of JS on their own (e.g. functions, arrays, methods, objects), I can't get my head around combining them to do something.
I added srcset for different screen sizes (the different images are in the img-assets folder), but it messed up JS. The thumbnail images were not displaying, only the alt text, so I deleted everything.

--If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
Java Script - I do not understand how to use it for a website, how to put all the parts together to make things work.
